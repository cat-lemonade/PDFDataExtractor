Yet, manual data\\nabstraction by humans with expert knowledge is an expensive,\\nlabor-intensive, and error-prone process. With the continued\\ngrowth of new publications, it is becoming increasingly diﬃcult\\nto create and maintain up-to-date manually curated databases,\\nand automated information extraction by machines is fast\\nbecoming a necessity.\\n\\nThe chemistry literature presents an attractive and tractable\\ntarget for this automated extraction as it is typically comprised\\nof formulaic, data-rich language that is well-suited for machine\\nanalysis with the potential for high recall and precision. The\\nextracted chemical\\ninformation can be used to create and\\npopulate databases of chemical structures, properties, and\\nobservations, opening up new avenues for discovery through\\nlarge-scale data mining studies that are of great value in diverse\\nareas\\nsuch as materials discovery, drug discovery, and\\nintellectual property protection.\\n\\nIn recent years, eﬀorts such as The Materials Genome\\nInitiative1 have led to an increased focus on large-scale data-\\nmining for materials discovery. Notable projects include the\\nHarvard Clean Energy Project,2 which focuses on materials for\\norganic photovoltaics, and the Materials Project,3 which focuses\\n\\non battery materials. These existing projects are primarily\\nconﬁned to exploiting computational\\nresources to predict\\nchemical properties, an approach that would be well\\ncomplemented by wider availability of machine-readable\\ndatabases of experimental properties. Moreover, a generic\\nmethod that can automatically generate a database for any type\\nof material property would extend the reach of existing eﬀorts\\nto all areas of materials science, rather than predeﬁning a focus\\non a speciﬁc area.\\n\\nWhile there are many well-established text-mining tools in\\nthe biomedical domain,4−7 chemistry and materials text-mining\\nis less widespread and fewer tools have been developed.\\nReviews by Eltyeb and Salim,8 Vazquez et al.,9 and Guru-\\nlingappa et al.10 provide comprehensive overviews of\\nthe\\nexisting chemistry text-mining tools and methods. Most of\\nthese tools focus narrowly on extracting speciﬁc entity types\\nfrom speciﬁc document domains, while there are relatively few\\nmethodologies that embrace a broader focus on the extraction\\nof chemical\\nincluding properties, experimental\\nmeasurements, and relationships between entities.\\n\\ninformation,\\n\\nOne such tool\\n\\nis ChemicalTagger,11 which parses exper-\\nimental synthesis sections of documents to determine chemical\\nroles (e.g., reactant, solvent) and relationships with exper-\\n\\nReceived: April 13, 2016\\nPublished: September 26, 2016\\n\\n© 2016 American Chemical Society\\n\\n1894\\n\\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00207\\nJ.

The toolkit provides a complete natural language\\nprocessing (NLP) pipeline that makes use of a wide range of\\nstate-of-the-art methods, including a chemistry-aware part-of-\\nspeech (POS) tagger, named entity recognizers that combine\\nconditional random ﬁelds and dictionaries, rule-based gram-\\nmars for phrase parsing, and word clustering to improve\\nperformance of machine learning methods through unsuper-\\nvised training. In addition, the toolkit includes a table parser for\\nextracting information from semistructured tabulated data, and\\ndocument-level postprocessing algorithms to resolve data\\ninterdependencies between information extracted from diﬀer-\\nent parts of a document.\\n\\nBy automating the extraction of chemical entities, properties,\\nmeasurements, and procedures, our\\ntoolkit enables vast\\nchemical databases to be created and populated with minimal\\ntime, eﬀort, and expense.\\n\\n■ IMPLEMENTATION\\n\\nSystem Overview. Our system provides an end-to-end\\ntext-mining pipeline that takes PDF, HTML, and XML ﬁles as\\ninput and produces an output of machine-readable structured\\ndata that is suitable for depositing in a database. Figure 1\\npresents an overview of the system. Our approach to each stage\\nof the process is described below.\\n\\nDocument Processing. The ﬁrst stage of the system is to\\nprocess PDF, HTML, and XML ﬁles to isolate the relevant\\ndocument domains, extract the raw text, and merge potentially\\nfragmented data from diﬀerent sources to produce a complete\\ndocument record. The end result is a consistent, simpliﬁed\\ndocument structure that consists of a single linear stream of\\ntitle, abstract, heading, paragraph, ﬁgure, and table document\\nelements. This allows subsequent components in the pipeline\\n\\nto process each document in exactly the same way, regardless of\\nthe original document format.\\n\\nFor text from HTML and XML sources, semantic markup of\\nheadings, paragraphs, captions and tables makes processing a\\ntrivial process. Once each text domain has been isolated, any\\nfurther embedded markup (for example specifying bold and\\nitalic characters) is stripped to produce plain text for natural\\nlanguage processing. For tables, individual cells are treated as\\nseparate text domains, and stored in nested lists that represent\\nthe original table structure.\\n\\nPDF documents present a greater challenge, as the format is\\nnot designed for the content to be easily interpreted by a\\nmachine. ChemDataExtractor provides layout analysis tools,\\nbuilt on top of the PDFMiner framework,18 that use the\\npositions of\\nimages and text characters to group text into\\nheadings, paragraphs, and captions.\\n\\nNatural Language Processing. The natural\\n\\nlanguage\\nprocessing pipeline extracts structured information from the\\nEnglish-language text in headings, paragraphs, and captions. It\\nis made up of ﬁve main stages: tokenization, part-of-speech\\ntagging, named entity recognition, phrase parsing, and\\ninformation extraction.

The tokenization process converts\\n\\ntext\\npassages into a stream of tokens that are suitable for natural\\nlanguage processing. Text is ﬁrst split into sentences, and then\\neach sentence is\\nthat broadly\\nsplit\\nfurther\\ncorrespond to individual words and punctuation.\\n\\ninto tokens\\n\\nOur system provides a sentence splitter that makes use of the\\nPunkt algorithm by Kiss and Strunk,19 which detects sentence\\nboundaries\\nthrough unsupervised learning of common\\nabbreviations and sentence starters. This algorithm has been\\nshown to be broadly applicable to many languages and text\\ndomains, and performs best when it has been trained on text\\nfrom the target domain.20 The unsupervised nature of this\\ntraining process makes this method particularly well-suited to\\nthe chemistry domain, where there is a huge archive of\\nliterature available, and yet, very few collections have been\\nmanually annotated with features such as sentence boundaries.\\nOur sentence splitter has been trained on the abstract, main\\ntext and captions of 3592 chemistry articles published by The\\nAmerican Chemical Society (ACS), The Royal Society of\\nChemistry (RSC), and Springer. The sentence splitter identiﬁes\\n702 132 individual sentences in the training articles, correctly\\ndistinguishing true sentence boundaries from full stops that\\noccur in abbreviations, such as “et al.”, “ﬁg.”, “ref.”, and “equiv.”\\nthat are prevalent in the chemistry literature.\\n\\n1895\\n\\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00207\\nJ.

However,\\nprevious work has shown that\\nthese\\nmethods can be improved by adding unsupervised word\\nrepresentations as extra word features.21 This is particularly\\nuseful\\nin the chemistry domain, where the relative lack of\\nannotated text collections for supervised training can be\\ncompensated for by using word cluster features derived from\\nthe extensive and widely available unannotated literature.\\n\\nthe performance of\\n\\nOur system makes use of\\n\\nfeatures derived from Brown\\nclustering,22 a form of hierarchical clustering of words based on\\nthe contexts in which they occur. This has been shown to\\nimprove the performance of part-of-speech tagging and named\\nentity recognition in a variety of domains.21,23−26 Figure 3\\nshows how various components of our natural\\nlanguage\\nprocessing pipeline incorporate both unsupervised and\\nsupervised learning.\\n\\nFigure 2. Natural language processing pipeline. Text is ﬁrst split into\\nsentences and then into individual tokens. The part-of-speech tagger\\nand entity recognizer outputs are combined to assign a single tag to\\neach token, which is then parsed using a rule-based grammar to\\nproduce a tree structure. This tree structure is interpreted to extract\\nindividual chemical records for this sentence, which are then combined\\nto resolve data\\nwith records\\ninterdependencies and produce uniﬁed records for depositing in a\\ndatabase. Tags shown: NN = noun, CD = cardinal number, VBZ =\\nverb (third person singular present), DT = determiner, NNS = noun\\nplural,\\nJJ = adjective, CC = coordinating\\nIN = preposition,\\nconjunction, CM = chemical mention.\\n\\nfrom throughout\\n\\nthe document\\n\\nThe word tokenizer has been designed to broadly match the\\nPenn Treebank policy, with some modiﬁcations to better\\nhandle chemistry text. Tokens are split on all whitespace and\\nmost punctuation characters, with exceptions for brackets,\\ncolons, and other symbols in certain situations to preserve\\nentities such as chemical names as a single token. Additionally,\\ncare is taken to consistently split units and mathematical\\nsymbols from numeric values, regardless of whether the source\\ntext contains a space between them.\\n\\nsystems\\n\\nto other\\n\\nthat normalize text prior\\n\\nText normalization is an important step that\\n\\nremoves\\ncommonly occurring inconsistencies that have a detrimental\\nimpact on the performance of machine learning and dictionary\\nmethods, and add unnecessary complexity to parsing rules. In\\ncontrast\\nto\\ntokenization, our tokenizer is designed to operate on any\\nsubsequently\\ninput, and normalization is\\nunicode text\\nperformed on the text content of each individual token. The\\nadvantage of this approach is that each token can retain a\\npointer to its exact start and end position within the source text,\\neven if normalization then changes the length of\\ntokens.\\nTherefore, the original token text can always be recovered, and\\nany information derived about a token can be easily annotated\\nback onto the original document.\\n\\nAs part of the normalization, unicode characters with similar\\nappearance that are often used interchangeably are stand-\\nardized, all nonprinting control characters are removed, and\\nalternative chemical spellings are uniﬁed.\\n\\nWord Clustering. To achieve good performance, many\\nmachine learning techniques that are used in natural language\\nprocessing must ﬁrst be trained in a supervised fashion by\\n\\nFigure 3. Supervised (solid lines) and unsupervised (dashed lines)\\ntraining methods for machine learning-based NLP components. The\\nsentence tokenizer relies entirely on unsupervised training using the\\nraw text of chemistry articles, whereas the part-of-speech tagger and\\nchemical entity recognizer combine unsupervised features from word\\nclusters with supervised training from labeled corpora, such as GENIA\\n(2000 MEDLINE abstracts with manually annotated part-of-speech\\ntags) and CHEMDNER (10 000 PubMed abstracts with manually\\nannotated chemical entity mentions).\\n\\nClustering was performed on the full text and captions of\\n3592 chemistry articles published by the ACS, RSC, and\\nSpringer. Once tokenized, this collection consists of about 20\\nmillion words in about 700 000 sentences. Clustering was\\nperformed using the Liang C++ implementation27 to produce\\n1500 clusters containing 372 799 unique words. Figure 4 shows\\nthe highest frequency words in seven example clusters. As\\nBrown clusters are hierarchical, diﬀerent length preﬁxes of the\\nbinary path correspond to cluster supersets, which can also be\\nused as features in machine learning methods.\\n\\nPart-of-Speech-Tagging. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging\\ninvolves assigning a tag to each token that describes its\\nsyntactic function, for example as a noun, verb or adjective.\\nEntity recognition, phrase parsing, and information extraction\\ntools routinely use the POS tags on tokens as part of their\\ninput, and thus their success is often highly dependent on the\\naccuracy of the tagging process.\\n\\nThe vast majority of publicly available natural\\n\\nlanguage\\nprocessing tools provide POS taggers that have been trained on\\nnewspaper articles, and therefore do not necessarily perform\\nwell on chemistry literature. Tsuruoka et al.4 found that by\\ntraining a POS tagger on a combined corpus of newspaper\\narticles (WSJ corpus28) and MEDLINE abstracts (GENIA\\ncorpus29), performance in the biomedical domain was greatly\\n\\n1896\\n\\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00207\\nJ.

In the absence of any equivalent POS-annotated\\ncorpus that covers the wider chemistry domain, the POS tagger\\nin our system makes use of the same newspaper and biomedical\\ntraining corpora but also supplements these with unsupervised\\nword cluster features derived from chemistry articles. This\\nimproves performance across a wider range of subject areas and\\ndocument domains (such as captions) that are not well-covered\\nby the training corpora.\\n\\nThe POS tagger uses a linear-chain conditional random ﬁeld\\n(CRF) model, trained using the orthant-wise limited-memory\\nquasi-Newton (OWL-QN) method as implemented by the\\nCRFsuite framework.30 The features for each token are shown\\nin Table 1.

In order to extract\\ninformation such as relations and properties, the named entities\\ninvolved must ﬁrst be recognized. The task of recognizing\\nchemical entity mentions in text is an area that has recently\\nreceived signiﬁcant attention. The best performing approaches\\ntypically involve a hybrid approach that combines dictionary\\n\\nand rule-based methods with machine learning methods. The\\nOSCAR4 recognizer,13 which uses a maximum-entropy Markov\\nmodel (MEMM), and ChemSpot,31 which uses a CRF model,\\nare two of the most well-established systems. More recently, the\\nCHEMDNER community challenge has promoted the\\ndevelopment of a number of new systems32 and provided the\\nCHEMDNER corpus of 10 000 PubMed abstracts with 84 355\\nmanually annotated chemical entity mentions.33\\n\\nDue to the wide variety of methods with diﬀering strengths,\\nour approach is to provide a modular architecture for named\\nfrom multiple\\nentity recognition that allows the results\\nmethodologies to be combined using heuristic techniques.\\nWe primarily use a CRF-based recognizer for chemical names,\\nin combination with a dictionary-based recognizer that provides\\nimproved performance for trivial and trade names, and a regular\\nexpression-based recognizer that excels for database identiﬁers\\nand chemical formulas.\\n\\nThe dictionary-based recognizer uses a word list compiled\\nfrom the Jochem chemical dictionary34 with an automatic\\nﬁltering process based on the method described by Lowe and\\nSayle14 that excludes entries that lead to false positives. For\\neﬃcient storage and fast string matching, the dictionary is\\nstored as a directed acyclic word graph (DAWG), which uses a\\ngraph-like representation to eliminate redundancy between\\nsimilar names.\\n\\nThe CRF-based recognizer uses a linear-chain CRF model,\\ntrained using the OWL-QN method as implemented by the\\nCRFsuite framework.30 The features that are generated for each\\ntoken are listed in Table 2. An “IOB” labeling scheme was\\nutilized, where each token is labeled as the beginning of a\\nchemical name (B),\\nin a chemical name (I), or outside a\\nchemical name (O). Training was performed using the training\\nsubset of the CHEMDNER corpus and the word clusters\\nderived from chemistry articles.\\n\\nPhrase Parsing. In general, parsing natural\\n\\nlanguage is a\\nchallenging problem, due to ambiguities that mean a single\\nsentence can sometimes be parsed in multiple diﬀerent ways to\\nproduce diﬀerent meanings. In practice, the formulaic and\\nprecise nature of the chemistry literature means that this occurs\\nless often, and parsing to a level that is adequate for information\\nextraction is much more tractable than in other domains.\\n\\nThe ChemicalTagger project pioneered the use of a rule-\\nbased grammar for parsing experimental synthesis sections of\\n\\n1897\\n\\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00207\\nJ.

Their strategy was to attempt to build one\\nuniversal grammar to parse all possible inputs, but this was\\npushing at the practical limits of a single rule-based grammar,\\neven within their relatively narrow target domain.\\n\\nOur alternative strategy is to make use of multiple, more\\nspecialized grammars that are tailored to extracting more\\nspeciﬁc types of chemical\\ninformation. Similarly to Chem-\\nicalTagger, our system produces input for the parser in the\\nform of a merged list of tags from the part-of-speech tagger and\\nchemical entity recognizer. Each grammar consists of a series of\\nnested rules that describe how sequences of tagged tokens can\\nbe translated into a tree model that represents the syntactic\\nstructure of each sentence. Grammars are deﬁned in simple\\nPython code, and unlike other tools, they do not need to be\\ncompiled before use.\\n\\nFigure 5a shows a simpliﬁed grammar, which recognizes\\ndeﬁnitions of alphanumeric compound labels in terms of a full\\nchemical name. The rules are primarily constructed using three\\ncore elements: T, which matches a token based on its POS or\\nentity tag, W, which matches the exact text of a token, and R,\\nwhich matches text patterns using regular expressions. The +\\noperator is used to deﬁne a required sequence of tokens, while\\n\\nFigure 5. Example rule-based parsing grammar\\nchemical names with an associated alphanumeric label.\\n\\nthat\\n\\nrecognizes\\n\\nthe | operator is used where just one of multiple alternatives is\\nrequired. Additional elements such as Optional, Zer-\\noOrMore, and Not allow more complex rules\\nto be\\nconstructed.\\n\\nIn the example grammar shown in Figure 5a, the ﬁrst rule,\\nname, matches a token with the tag B-CM, followed by zero or\\nmore tokens with the tag I-CM, corresponding to the output\\ntags of the chemical named entity recognizer. The second rule,\\nlabel, deﬁnes two regular expression patterns, one for\\nalphanumeric labels and one for Roman numerals, either of\\nwhich may be matched. The ﬁnal rule, cem, is deﬁned in terms\\nof the ﬁrst two rules. It requires a name, followed by a label\\nenclosed within brackets. Figure 5b shows an illustration of the\\ntree data structure that results from applying this grammar to\\nan example sentence.\\n\\nTable Parsing. Tables are a highly attractive target for\\ninformation extraction due to both their high data density and\\nalso their semistructured nature that facilitates interpretation in\\ncomparison to completely unstructured natural\\nlanguage.\\nDespite the lack of strict table format standardization, many\\ntables in the chemistry literature follow broad conventions that\\nmake accurate interpretation possible through rule-based\\nmethods.\\n\\nAn overview of the table parsing system is shown in Figure 6.\\nAt present, ChemDataExtractor primarily targets tables in\\n\\nFigure 6. Overview of the main stages in the table parsing system\\n(left) applied to a simpliﬁed example table (right). First, table headings\\nare parsed to classify the type of each column, and then all the cells in\\neach row are parsed to produce a compound record. The data\\ninterdependency resolution process incorporates information from the\\ntable caption and elsewhere in the document to produce the ﬁnal\\nrecord.\\n\\nwhich each row corresponds to a single chemical entity, and\\neach column describes property values for that entity. By\\ntreating each individual table cell as a short, highly formulaic\\ninformation can be extracted using a specialized\\nsentence,\\nlanguage processing pipeline.

After each cell has been separately tokenized\\nand tagged, the heading cells are parsed to determine the\\ncolumn types and units. In this case, the ﬁrst column contains\\nchemical entity identiﬁers, and the second column contains\\ncombined UV−vis wavelength and extinction values. Each\\nsubsequent row is then processed individually to produce a\\nchemical record, taking into account the column classiﬁcation\\nfrom each heading to choose the appropriate parsing grammar\\nfor the cells below.\\n\\nData Interdependency Resolution. In many cases, the\\ninformation extracted from a single sentence, caption or table\\ncan be meaningless or even misleading without the context\\nprovided by the rest of the document. The ﬁnal stage of our\\nsystem involves postprocessing to resolve these data\\ninterdependencies and combine the data from individual\\ndocument domains into a single complete structured record\\nfor each unique chemical entity that is mentioned in the\\ndocument.\\n\\nChemical Identiﬁer Disambiguation. Initially, each heading,\\nparagraph, caption and table is processed completely\\nindependently to produce structured chemical records that\\nare deﬁned in terms of whatever chemical name, abbreviation,\\nor identiﬁer is used locally in that context. The records from\\nthroughout the document are then combined into a single list,\\nand records that refer to the same chemical entity are merged\\ninto a single record (Figure 7).\\n\\nOur system detects deﬁnitions of chemical abbreviations and\\nlabels using a method based on the algorithm by Hearst and\\nSchwartz.35 This algorithm is applied to all sentences in the\\ndocument to produce a list of mappings between abbreviations\\nand their corresponding full unabbreviated names. These\\nmappings are then used to merge data that is deﬁned in\\nterms of diﬀerent identiﬁers into single records for each unique\\nchemical entity.\\n\\nGlobal Contextual Information. In some cases, a sentence\\ncontains spectroscopic attributes or property information but is\\nlacking any speciﬁc chemical identiﬁcation information. Often,\\nfor example in experimental sections of a research article, the\\nidentiﬁcation information may be available in the\\nchemical\\npreceding sentence or heading, and if so,\\nthis is used.\\nOtherwise,\\ntypically contain contextual\\ninformation (for example, a temperature, solvent, or apparatus)\\nthat is applicable to all properties or spectra of a certain type. In\\nthese cases, the information is merged into all other records for\\nall spectra or properties of that type and the record itself is\\nremoved.\\n\\nthese sentences\\n\\nFinal Data Model. Figure 8 presents the schema of the ﬁnal\\ndata model. The extracted data are primarily based around\\nchemical entity records that contain all the names, abbrevia-\\ntions and labels that were used in the document to refer to a\\ngiven chemical entity. Each chemical entity record can have\\nmultiple associated spectra and properties, and each spectrum\\ncan also optionally contain information about individual peaks.\\nChemDataExtractor comes with built-in parsers and extractors\\nfor the speciﬁc property and spectrum types shown in Figure 8;\\nhowever, the extensible and modular design of ChemDataEx-\\ntractor means that it is straightforward for users to build\\nadditional parsers and extractors for other property and\\nspectrum types.\\n\\nThe ﬁnal chemical records may be saved directly to a\\ndocument-oriented NoSQL database, or to a relational database\\n\\nthrough the use of an object-relational mapper. Alternatively,\\nthey may be exported to a variety of ﬁle formats including\\nMicrosoft Excel, SDF, CSV, or JSON.\\n\\n■ EVALUATION\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics. For all aspects of\\n\\nthe system,\\nperformance has been evaluated in terms of precision (the\\npercentage of retrieved results that are correct), recall (the\\npercentage of correct results that are retrieved), and F-score\\n(harmonic mean of precision and recall). These are deﬁned as\\n\\nprecision\\n\\n=\\n\\nrecall\\n\\n=\\n\\nTP\\n+\\n\\nFP\\n\\nTP\\n\\nTP\\n+\\n\\nTP\\n\\nFN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nF score\\n\\n‐\\n\\n= ·\\n2\\n\\nprecision recall\\n\\n·\\n+\\n\\nprecision\\n\\nrecall\\n(3)\\nwhere TP is a true positive that the system correctly identiﬁed,\\nFP is a false positive that the system incorrectly identiﬁed, and\\nFN is a false negative that the system failed to recognize.\\n\\nEvaluation of Information Extraction from Academic\\nJournals. Overall performance was evaluated by applying\\nChemDataExtractor to a test collection of 50 open-access\\nchemistry articles that were selected from journals published by\\nthe ACS, RSC, and Springer. The precision, recall and F-score\\nfor the extraction of various diﬀerent kinds of information were\\ncalculated by comparing ChemDataExtractor’s output with a\\ngold standard output36 that was manually compiled especially\\nfor this evaluation. Strict guidelines were developed to ensure\\nmanual extraction was performed consistently.\\n\\nChemical entities, spectra, and properties were extracted\\nfrom the abstract, main text, tables, and ﬁgure captions. For this\\nevaluation, extraction of melting point, oxidation and reduction\\npotentials, photoluminescence lifetime, and quantum yield\\nproperties was considered, as well as NMR, UV−vis, and IR\\nspectroscopic attributes. The relevant chemical entities were\\nrestricted to those with associated spectra or properties, or with\\nan assigned alphanumeric label. All information that is deﬁned\\nsolely within a scheme or ﬁgure image or a separate Supporting\\nInformation document was considered outside the scope of our\\nsystem and was therefore excluded from the evaluation.\\n\\nTable 3 presents the overall precision, recall, and F-score\\nvalues for the extraction of chemical identiﬁers, spectroscopic\\n\\nTable 3.

Accurately matching\\nalphanumeric labels to the relevant chemical name is a vital\\nprerequisite to successfully extracting any spectra and proper-\\nties that are deﬁned solely in terms of a label.\\n\\nSpectroscopic Attributes. An evaluation of ChemDataEx-\\ntractor’s ability to extract various spectroscopic attributes is\\nshown in Table 5. As well as assessing the extraction of each\\nindividual spectrum attribute, the extraction of overall spectrum\\nrecords is presented.\\n\\nTable 5.

This is due\\nto the rule-based nature of the parsers in ChemDataExtractor,\\nwhich are well-suited to the formulaic language and structure of\\nscientiﬁc articles that leave little room for misinterpretation.\\n\\nContextual spectroscopic attributes such as temperature and\\napparatus present the greatest challenge in terms of resolving\\ninterdependencies between information that has been extracted\\nfrom diﬀerent document domains. For example, a spectrum\\nmay have peaks listed in a table, temperature mentioned in a\\nﬁgure caption, and apparatus mentioned in the main text,\\nleading to the slightly lower recall values of 87.5% and 91.0%\\nfor temperature and apparatus, respectively. The ability to\\naccurately match together these disparate pieces of information\\nis a unique strength of ChemDataExtractor, yet also presents\\nthe greatest opportunity for further improvement.\\n\\nChemical Properties. Table 6 presents the precision, recall,\\nand F-score for the extraction of diﬀerent aspects of chemical\\nproperty information, as well as the overall property record.\\n\\nTable 6.

In these cases, while the value and units are normally\\nissue, complex sentence structures often\\nextracted without\\nresult\\nin a failure to assign a chemical subject. Errors in\\nextraction from tables also occasionally arise from complex\\ntable structures; for example where some table cells are merged\\nacross multiple rows or columns, as this can introduce\\nambiguity around the exact scope of the cell contents.\\n\\nEvaluation of Information Extraction from Patents.\\nThe performance of ChemDataExtractor was also tested against\\npatent documents. To this end, a case study on melting points\\nwas used for the evaluation since it oﬀers a good comparison to\\nthe recent work of Tetko et al.,15 who have generated a data set\\nof 241 958 melting points, which were mined from US patents\\nusing LeadMine14 in combination with a customized version of\\nChemicalTagger.11 A comparative evaluation was performed by\\napplying ChemDataExtractor to a representative subset of the\\npatents used in their study and comparing the extracted melting\\npoint records from the two generated data sets. The subset\\ncomprised a sample of 2000 patents, which were drawn from a\\nrandom selection of US patent grants that were published in\\nthe years 2005−2014 and were present in the melting point\\ndata set published by Tetko et al.\\n\\nIn total, ChemDataExtractor obtained 18 180 unique melting\\npoints while Tetko et al. obtained 13 198 from this sample.\\nThere is an overlap of 8978 melting points that match exactly\\nbetween the two data sets, giving a shared total of 22 400\\nin addition to the 8978\\nunique melting points. Therefore,\\n(40%) that are common to both data sets, there are 9202\\n(41%) that occur only in the ChemDataExtractor data set and\\n4220 (19%) that occur only in the Tetko data set. These\\nnonmatching subsets include a further 202 compounds that are\\npresent in both data sets but with diﬀering melting point values.\\nOf the overall set of 9180 common compounds, 97.8% have\\nidentical melting points, while the remaining melting point\\npairings diﬀer by a root mean squared deviation of 63 °C.\\n\\nWhen interpreting these values, it is important to note that\\nTetko et al. removed duplicate values across their entire data\\nset, prior to the evaluation sample being taken, while the\\nChemDataExtractor duplicate values were only removed by\\nconsidering the evaluation sample itself. The published Tetko\\ndata set only references a single patent for each melting point,\\neven if it was extracted from multiple ones, so many of the\\nmelting point values that appear to be missing from the\\nLeadMine-extracted evaluation sample from 2000 patents were\\nin fact intentionally discarded because they were considered to\\n\\n1901\\n\\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00207\\nJ. Chem. Inf. Model. 2016, 56, 1894−1904\\n\\nJournal of Chemical Information and Modeling\\n\\nArticle\\n\\nbe a duplicate of a value from another patent outside the\\nsample. Also, 2557 compounds for which melting points appear\\nto have been only extracted by ChemDataExtractor do in fact\\noccur in the overall Tetko data set as extracted from a diﬀerent\\npatent. If the beneﬁt of the doubt is given and all of these cases\\nare assumed to be duplicate removals, 11 535 (51%) of values\\nare common to both tools, 6645 (30%) occur only in the\\nChemDataExtractor data set, and 4220 (19%) occur only in the\\nTetko data set. Tetko et al. also discarded an unspeciﬁed\\nnumber of melting points that failed with descriptor calculation\\nprograms, which may further account for diﬀerences between\\nthe two data sets.\\n\\nDespite these diﬀerences, Table 7 shows that there is good\\nagreement between the data sets in terms of this classiﬁcation\\n\\nTable 7.

To facilitate comparison with\\nother text mining tools, recognition of\\nindividual chemical\\nmentions was evaluated. This evaluation was performed using\\nthe CHEMDNER corpus.33 This consists of 3000 abstracts\\nfrom across the chemistry domain that have been manually\\nannotated with 25 351 chemical entity mentions. Results were\\ncalculated using the bc-evaluate tool provided by the\\nCHEMDNER organizers.\\n\\nTable 8 shows the precision, recall and F-score for the\\nindividual CRF, dictionary and regular expression components\\n\\nTable 8.

The overall combined F-score of\\n87.8% exceeds the scores achieved by all the tools that oﬃcially\\nentered the CHEMDNER chemical names extraction chal-\\nlenge.32 The two best entries were tmChem by Leaman et al.,37\\nwhich achieved an F-score of 87.39%, and a system by Lu et\\nal.,38 which achieved an F-score of 87.11%. Lu et al. have since\\npublished an alternative version of their system that achieved an\\nF-score of 88.06%, which outperforms ChemDataExtractor on\\nthis statistic by 0.3%.\\n\\nThe CRF recognizer with word cluster features is the best\\nperforming individual component, with an F-score of 84.9%.\\nWhile the dictionary recognizer has similar precision to the\\nCRF, it has inferior recall, primarily caused by poor recognition\\nof systematic names and chemical formulas.

POS tagging performance was evaluated\\ntwo diﬀerent corpora that have been\\nthrough the use of\\nmanually annotated with POS tags: The Wall Street Journal\\n(WSJ) corpus,28 which consists of 1 million words from 1989\\nWall Street Journal news articles, and the GENIA corpus,29\\nwhich consists of 2000 MEDLINE abstracts that cover the\\nbiomedical domain. The standard WSJ splitting convention was\\n\\n1902\\n\\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00207\\nJ. Chem. Inf.

The ﬁrst 90% of the GENIA corpus\\nwas used for training, and the remaining 10% for evaluation,\\nmatching the split used by Tsuruoka et al.4 in developing a\\nbiomedical POS tagger.\\n\\nTable 9 presents the POS tagging accuracy of diﬀerent\\ntraining conﬁgurations on the WSJ and GENIA evaluation\\n\\nTable 9.

Supervised training was performed using the WSJ and\\nGENIA training corpora individually, and also both combined.\\nThe eﬀect of adding unsupervised features from word clusters\\nwas also evaluated on each of these three conﬁgurations.\\n\\nTaggers trained individually on either the WSJ or the GENIA\\ncorpus achieved the best performance when evaluated on that\\nsame corpus but aﬀorded the poorest performance when\\nevaluated on the opposite corpus. The tagger trained on the\\nWSJ training corpus achieved an accuracy of 97.23% on the\\nWSJ evaluation corpus, which falls to 84.15% on the GENIA\\nevaluation corpus. Likewise, the tagger trained on the GENIA\\ntraining corpus achieved an accuracy of 98.62% on the GENIA\\nevaluation corpus, which falls to 81.19% on the WSJ evaluation\\ncorpus.\\n\\nThe tagger trained on the combined WSJ and GENIA\\ncorpora achieves good accuracy on both evaluation corpora,\\nwith 97.08% on the WSJ evaluation corpus and 98.34% on the\\nGENIA evaluation corpus. This matches the observations of\\nTsuruoka et al., indicating that using the combined newspaper\\nand biomedical training sets extends coverage over both and\\nhas little negative impact compared to the specialized training\\nfor a speciﬁc domain.\\n\\nThe addition of word cluster features has a positive eﬀect in\\nall cases, but this is most signiﬁcant in the cases where there is a\\nmismatch between the training corpus and the evaluation\\ncorpus. The accuracy of the WSJ-trained tagger on the GENIA\\ncorpus rises from 83.50% to 84.15%, and the accuracy of the\\nGENIA-trained tagger on the WSJ corpus rises from 78.88% to\\n81.19%. This suggests that unsupervised word cluster features\\nare capable of broadening the coverage of a POS tagger outside\\nthe domain of its supervised training and, therefore, should lead\\nto improved performance across the wider chemistry domain\\nfor the tagger trained on the combined WSJ and GENIA\\n\\ncorpus.■ CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nChemDataExtractor is able to automatically extract chemical\\ninformation from scientiﬁc documents, facilitating the creation\\nof massive chemical databases with minimal time and eﬀort.\\nThe system consists of a modular document processing\\npipeline with extensible components for natural\\nlanguage\\nprocessing that achieve state-of-the-art performance for POS\\ntagging and chemical named entity recognition.\\n\\nArticle\\n\\nIn contrast to most existing text-mining systems that focus\\non extracting entities from individual sentences, ChemDataEx-\\ntractor provides a table processor for extraction of tabulated\\nexperimental properties and document-level processing algo-\\nrithms to resolve data interdependencies and produce uniﬁed\\nchemical records that incorporate information from multiple\\ndocument domains. Evaluations demonstrate good perform-\\nance in the extraction of chemical entities and their associated\\nexperimental properties and spectroscopic data.\\n\\nThe generic and extensible design of the system means it can\\napplied to the extraction of any chemical properties, measure-\\nments and relationships with minimal additional eﬀort. This\\nleads to the ultimate goal of quickly autogenerating chemical\\nstructure and property databases for materials science and other\\nﬁelds.

Yet, manual data abstraction by humans with expert knowledge is an expensive, labor-intensive, and error-prone process. With the continued growth of new publications, it is becoming increasingly diﬃcult to create and maintain up-to-date manually curated databases, and automated information extraction by machines is fast becoming a necessity.',\n",
       "  'The chemistry literature presents an attractive and tractable target for this automated extraction as it is typically comprised of formulaic, data-rich language that is well-suited for machine analysis with the potential for high recall and precision. The extracted chemical information can be used to create and populate databases of chemical structures, properties, and observations, opening up new avenues for discovery through large-scale data mining studies that are of great value in diverse areas such as materials discovery, drug discovery, and intellectual property protection.',\n",
       "  'In recent years, eﬀorts such as The Materials Genome Initiative1 have led to an increased focus on large-scale data- mining for materials discovery. Notable projects include the Harvard Clean Energy Project,2 which focuses on materials for organic photovoltaics, and the Materials Project,3 which focuses',\n",
       "  'on battery materials. These existing projects are primarily conﬁned to exploiting computational resources to predict chemical properties, an approach that would be well complemented by wider availability of machine-readable databases of experimental properties. Moreover, a generic method that can automatically generate a database for any type of material property would extend the reach of existing eﬀorts to all areas of materials science, rather than predeﬁning a focus on a speciﬁc area.',\n",

      "For policymakers, planners, urban design practitioners and city service decision-makers who endeavour to create policies and take decisions to improve the function of cities, developing an understanding of cities, and the particular city in question, is important. However, in the ever-increasing ﬁeld of urban measurement and analysis, the challenges cities face are frequently presumed: crime and fear of crime, social inequality, environmental degradation, economic deterioration and disjointed governance. Although it may be that many cities share similar problems, it is unwise to assume that cities share the same challenges, to the same degree or in the same combination. And yet, diagnosing the challenges a city faces is often overlooked in preference for improving the understanding of known challenges. To address this oversight, this study evidences the need to diagnose urban challenges, introduces a novel mixed-methods approach for doing so, applies (and critiques) the approach to the city of Birmingham, UK, and proposes a set of principles for the transferability of this new urban diagnostic methodology to other cities. The paper argues that applying a rigorous, explorative, diagnostic approach to ‘reading cities’ provides conﬁdence that all critical challenges have been identiﬁed and, crucially, identiﬁes how they are interdependent, both of which have implications for how policymakers and decision-makers address a particular city's combination of interlinked challenges.\n",

      "City bus drivers are facing increasingly stressful work situations. In urban areas, bus drivers are competing for limited road space with various vehicles in mixed trafﬁc conditions. This mixed trafﬁc ﬂow condition may not only cause trafﬁc congestion problems but also increase the driving fatigue of a city bus driver. In addition, the average number of elderly passengers are increasing. Constrained by their physical conditions, elderly passengers usually take more time to get on or off a bus and require a city bus driver’s special attention or help. An increase in elderly passengers using city buses may increase the bus driver’s stress and/or fatigue levels. This study developed a structural equation model to investi- gate the causal relationships between a vector of stress factors and city bus drivers’ fatigue levels from a risk management perspective. The empirical study results based on a ques- tionnaire survey indicated that mixed trafﬁc ﬂow conditions and the characteristics of elderly passengers are positively correlated with the levels of driving fatigue in city bus dri- vers. An increase in the number of motor scooters in a trafﬁc stream and/or elderly passen- gers on a bus will lead to higher levels of mental fatigue for a city bus driver. This study discussed the effects of several stressors on a city bus driver’s fatigue and provided sugges- tions for changes in policies to ensure the fatigue mitigation of city bus drivers.\n",

      "During  the  heating  season  in  the  “Three  North”  area  of  China,  the  wind  curtailment  has  become  a  serious  problem due to the lack of space for grid-connected wind power. Firstly, from the perspective of improving the  acceptance capacity of wind power curtailment, this paper establishes a model of hybrid energy storage. Then  considering the influence of the frequently changing electrodes of the regenerative electric boiler on its working  life, this paper introduces the optimization coefficient of electrodes, and the optimal operation strategy of hybrid  energy  storage  system  is  put  forward.  Finally,  based  on  the  actual  data  of  200  MW  wind  farm,  this  paper  compares and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of different control methods. The results show that the  proposed method can further improve the power system’s ability to accept wind power, under the requirements  of meeting the heating demand and reducing the number of electrode adjustment of electric boilers.   \n",

      "In this paper we aim to analyze the status of investment and ﬁnancing of photovoltaic power generation in Cameroon, ﬁnd out the challenges it faces, and put forward solutions. Through in-depth analyses of the investment and ﬁnancing data of photovoltaic power generation from Cameroon, reference countries and the world during 2008e2019 and by drawing lessons from international experiences, we ﬁnd that Cameroon’s investment and ﬁnancing is far from meeting the needs of its photovoltaic power generation development. The causal analyses show that the root causes leading to insufﬁcient investment and ﬁnancing of photovoltaic power generation in Cameroon are the government behavior defects. On this basis, using the appropriate problem-oriented analysis method, we put forward policy recommendations to improve the investment and ﬁnancing situation of photovoltaic power generation in Cameroon. The basic conclusion of this paper is that the low investment scale, single ﬁnancing structure, violent in- vestment ﬂuctuation and ﬁnancing gap are the surface causes of slowing photovoltaic power generation in Cameroon, while the lack of consciousness about attracting international investment, the ambiguity of the application process for photovoltaic power generation projects, the lack of speciﬁc measures to stimulate photovoltaic power generation, and the backward national planning of photovoltaic power generation are the internal reasons delaying Cameroon’s photovoltaic power generation. This study not only beneﬁts Cameroon by being a guide for optimizing and promoting the development of photovoltaic power generation, but also has universal reference value for other similar research.\n",

      "Porcine pancreatic stem cells (pPSCs) can be induced to insulin-secreting cells and therefore considered the most promising seeding cells for curing human diabetes in future. However, insuﬃcient pPSCs number is one of the bottleneck problems before its clinical application. SerpinB1 is a serine protease inhibitor in neutrophils and can directly promote the proliferation of β cells. Whether SerpinB1 is involved in pPSC proliferation and diﬀer- entiation remains unknown. The eﬀects of SerpinB1 on pPSCs proliferation were measured by Cell Counting Kit- 8, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, qRT-PCR, western blot, and ﬂow cytometry assays. We found that pPSCs did not eﬃciently reach the S phase when SerpinB1 expression was knocked down with short hairpin RNA (sh- SerpinB1), the expression of Cyclin D1, CDK-2, and PCNA also decreased. Meanwhile, cell viability and pro- liferation ability were both declined. Further analyses showed that the expression level of phosphorylated STAT3/STAT3was downregulated, along with an upregulation of p53 and p21. We used a two-step induction method to induce pPSCs to insulin-secreting cells and found that SerpinB1 expression in insulin-secreting cells was higher than in pPSCs. Meanwhile, the protein expression level of phosphorylated STAT3/STAT3 was in- creased while p53 and p21 was decreased in induced insulin-secreting cells in comparison with control cells. The insulin-secreting cells derived from the sh-SerpinB1 cells secreted less insulin and showed poor sensitivity to high glucose than control group. However, the insulin-secreting cells derived from the ov-SerpinB1 cells has a quite contrary tendency. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SerpinB1 promotes the proliferation of pPSCs through the STAT3 signaling pathway, and SerpinB1 is a key factor for maintaining the viability of pPSCs during the transition to insulin-secreting cells.\n",

      "Cities are increasingly challenged to improve their competitiveness. Performance indicators stand as an important element to interpret the success of the policy regime adopted by the municipality. Cities with a set of superior economic, social and environmental indicators have the potential to present better living conditions for their inhabitants. In this context, the aim of this research is to analyze whether the in- dicators published by Brazilian cities are aligned with the approach of a smart or sustainable city. The research used a set of 3150 data points regarding the performance of these cities. It analyzed the per- formance of the 150 best cities, divided into three groups of interest identiﬁed as small cities, medium- sized cities and big cities, on a set of 21 indicators. The set of identiﬁed indicators shows the attention of the cities to socioeconomic and information and communication technologies issues, thus revealing that Brazilian city managers are more interested in positioning their cities as smart than sustainable. Analysis of the general indicators of the cities, supported by the number of inhabitants, indicated that big cities present superior performance in relation to medium-sized cities, and that the latter perform better in relation to the small cities. However, small cities in the individualized analysis of social indicators present a better-performing set.\n",
